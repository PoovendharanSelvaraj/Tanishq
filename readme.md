<h1>Cloning TANISHQ website</h1>


<p>
  Hi reader, I am writing this blog to share my team’s experience of cloning a website named “TANISQH”. So TANISQH is a “JEWELLERY” website (TYPE-Ecommerce) that helps users to shop jewels online. TANISQH is totally ecommerce based website that completely transformed the way of online jewels shopping. It is a flexible website where one can shop from different category of jewels in different categories.
Our team tried to clone the website in a week. Our Team members tried with full potential to create this website.
The following members were the part of our team :Amar, Juned, Parth, Shubham.
Concepts we are used to clone this website
<ol>
  <li>HTML</li>
 <li>CSS</li>
 <li>DOM</li>
 <li>Media Query</li>
<li>javascript</li>
  </ol>
We used the following resources for our help:
<ul>
  <li>web gradients</li>
<li>fontawesome</li>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Mdn dev</li>
  <li>getcssscan</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  We are expecting to create perfect cloned site but due to shortage of time we decided to complete the user flow of the project that is user should see Landing page of the website, user should be able to signup and sign in, redirected to landing page and then user can select the respective categories to shop, select and place the order.

  <h2>
  CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM
</h2>
<p>
 <ul> This is the first time for us to work on a project remotely with a team. We faced some challenges during completion of this project.</ul>
<ul>We started the project by creating a group which is first and most important task that is connecting with our teammates but I didn’t have contact of other members so I tried to connect them on slack and ask their contact and successfully created a group or can say a workspace where we can share our work or our ideas.
After that we scheduled our first zoom meeting on Monday evening where we discussed how we can move ahead during this whole construct week. </ul>
 <ul>We analyzed the website and prepared a google sheet of our work which has to be done and shared among all teammates.</ul>
 <ul>As we move ahead working in a team so we needed to share each others code so that there is no conflict, we needed Github for that but a new challenge was waiting for us. We were familiar with Github but only for standalone projects and this time it was going to be totally new for us and a small mistake could ruin our project so we decided to first learn how to use Github and then use it.
After that we created a repository on GITHUB where all the code and data was shared.</ul>
 <ul>Group members were added as collaborators and also a reviewer was selected among team member who continued to review the codes that was pushed to the origin of our repository.</ul>
Our next challenge was to record the data of how and how many tasks had been completed by each team member so we decided to schedule a meeting every morning and show their work and also discuss what to do today and how much task is left.
We are facing issues whenever we require some additional concepts which are not a part of this unit but necessary to build this project. To overcome this we skipped some parts and also learned new concepts from google and youtube.com and applied them.
After crossing each and every barrier we have finally completed the cloning of the our website.
Conclusion
The experience we gained from building this project will be useful for the rest of life. The way we shared our knowledge and worked as a team following the team collaborations rules. It is very mandatory to work as a team if you are going to perform such a huge task, I would like to say thankyou to MASAI SCHOOL who gave us the opportunity to work together as a team. Together we learnt so many new things and also revised our concepts and successfully implemented them. I am glad to work with a great team and want to say thanks to all my team members with their continuous support the project completion was possible in the given time.
